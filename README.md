# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression

## Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Text preprocessing
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Model saving and reuse

## Result
The model performs well in distinguishing fake and real news articles.

## Future Improvements
- Try Naive Bayes or SVM
- Deploy as a web application
